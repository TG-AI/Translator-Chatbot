# Project Title
Translation Chatbot on Telegram!

## Getting started
To have the chatbot up and running through your local system, clone the repository locally and run:
```
python2 translatorbot.py
```
Chatbot is only functional on Telegram when running on your local machine. Previously, deployment was done using Heroku and Dropbox. However, monthly payments were required, making me stop it! :(

## Prerequisites
1. Python2 or later version
2. Telegram
3. Telepot library (Telegram Bot API)

## Working of the chatbot
